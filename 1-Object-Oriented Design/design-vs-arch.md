# Design vs Architecture

Typically, the `software designer` role would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities. 

A `software architect` role would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other.

Software design is the process of turning the wishes and requirements of a customer into working code that is stable and maintainable in the long run, and can be evolved and can become part of a larger system. 

architecture is primarily, begins with understanding what's the business problem that the client needs to solve.

## Challenges
- One of the key challenges in software architecture is the tendency to have to trade off between speed and quality. there's a tendency for the customer in the business to want their results as soon as possible. And there's a tendency for the engineering team to want to build, the most robust, thoroughly designed, thoroughly implemented system possible.

- our biggest issue that we face is understanding the client's problem. What is it they really want to do? And in many cases the client actually doesn't know what they want to do either. They come in with only a partial understanding, a vague kind of sense that they could be doing things better.

## Software Architect Job
A software architect's job is to be the interface between the product and the customer and the engineering teams. customers will express a requirement of the software. it's the architect's job to then work with the customers and their representatives, product managers and such, to come up with the technical requirements of how we're going to solve the problem. And then they take those requirements to the engineering teams and worked with the engineers on how to realize that in a way that is meeting the customer's requirements and also aligned with the technical best practices and nonfunctional requirements that have to be adhered to in the product.

## Simplicity
it has benefits:
-  if it's simple, you probably have a pretty good chance of getting it right
- you can explain it to someone simply
