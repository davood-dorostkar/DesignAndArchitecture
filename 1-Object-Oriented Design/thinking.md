# Object Oriented Thinking

## Objects Structure

- Objects may have specific details associated with them

- Objects might also have behaviours or responsibilities associated
with them

## OO Benefits

- **Organized**: Objects keep code organized by putting related details and specific functions in distinct, easy-to-find places

- **Flexible**: details can be easily changed in a modular way within the object, without affecting the rest of the code

- **Reusable**: as they reduce the amount of code that needs to be created, and keeps programs simple

## OO attributes
- Objects are self-aware in software production, even if they are
inanimate objects. For example, a mobile phone “knows” its specifications.

- In object-oriented thinking, often everything is considered an
object, even if animate or live
