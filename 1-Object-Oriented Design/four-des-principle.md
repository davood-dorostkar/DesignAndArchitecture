# Four Design Principles

## Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the main ways that humans deal with complexity. Abstraction is the idea of simplifying a concept in the problem domain to its `essentials` within some context. Abstraction allows you to better understand a concept by breaking it down into a simplified description that ignores `unimportant details`. 

### Benefits
- emphasizes the essentials needed for the concept and removes details that are not essential. 
- an abstraction should make sense for the concept's purpose.

### Rule of Least Astonishment
the abstraction captures the essential attributes and behavior for a concept with no surprises and no definitions that fall beyond its scope. You don't want to surprise anyone trying to understand your abstraction with irrelevant characteristics.

>The abstractions you create are relative to some context, and there can be different abstractions for one concept. It is up to you to choose the abstraction that is most appropriate for your purpose.

>Within the context of an abstraction, anything other than a concept's essential attributes and behaviors is irrelevant.

If the purpose of your system or the problem changes, don't be afraid to update your abstractions accordingly.
